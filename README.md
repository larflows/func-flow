# Functional Flows Calculator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leogoesger/func-flow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leogoesger/func-flow)

## About

This project uses [Python3](https://www.python.org/)

## Getting Started in 4 simple steps (Mac OS)

1. Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/) and a [text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) of your choice.
2. Clone your project in [Terminal](http://www.informit.com/blogs/blog.aspx?uk=The-10-Most-Important-Linux-Commands)

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/larflows/func-flow.git
   cd func-flow/
   ```

3. Create and activate virtualenv

   ```
   python3 -m venv my-virtualenv
   source my-virtualenv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Getting Started in 5 steps (Windows)

1. Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and a [text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) of your choice.
2. Add Python to [System Path](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/)

   - Locate `Python3` from your local computer. Usually located in the following folder:

     ```
     C:\python3
     ```

     or

     ```
     C:\Users\your-name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32
     ```

   - Follow this [link](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/) from step 2 to the end.
   - Go into Command Prompt by typing `cmd` in search bar, and type `python`. You should see the following:

     ```
     Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48ecebad5, Dec 18 2017, 21:07:28)
     [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
     Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
     >>>
     ```

   - Type `exit()` to exit the python shell.

3. Clone your project in [Command Prompt](http://www.informit.com/blogs/blog.aspx?uk=The-10-Most-Important-Linux-Commands)

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/larflows/func-flow.git
   cd func-flow
   ```

4. Create and activate virtualenv

   ```
   python -m venv my-virtualenv
   my-virtualenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. Install dependencies

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Run Script

1. In project directory

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Using referee (R interface)

General note: during installation of dependencies, some may fail to install.  Only numpy, pandas and spicy
are required for the components of func-flow used by referee, so it will quite likely be able to run successfully
anyway.

The R interface allows uploading from data frames and reading out results.  For now, the variable EFF_DIR in referee.R must be
set to the top-level func-flow directory.  Python 3 must be used; if a virtual environment is being used (as per
the directions above),
set VENV_PATH appropriately and uncomment the line that calls `use_virtualenv`.  Otherwise, make sure
PYTHON_PATH is set appropriately to use Python 3.  The program will not work with Python 2.  If dependencies
were installed to the virtual env (following the instructions above), then the virtual env must be used as
the dependencies will not have been installed globally.  If you get dependency errors, the most likely
solution is to make sure that referee is set to use the virtual env and the path specified appropriately.  In
this case also make sure that the like `use_python(...)` is commented out.  The current default is to use
the virtual env, but the path must still be specified.

Multi-gage flow data can be uploaded through `upload_gagedata`, which requires a data frame with the columns `gage` (character),
`data` (character - mm/dd/yyyy), and `flow` (cfs).  The data for a single gage can be uploaded by using `write_input_df` and then
`upload_files`, and the data can be put into the appropriate format with `make_input_df`.

Results can be read out into data frames (specifically, tibbles) through `get_annual_flow_result`.  `get_annual_flow_matrix` and
`get_drh` are also available, but do not process the data into a user-friendly format, unlike `get_annual_flow_result` (as
the annual flow result data appears to be the most relevant).

The function `process_gages` will take a multi-gage data frame and return a list of all of the flow result data frames without
any other user intervention.  It will also work with a single gage with or without a gage column.  It is unlikely that most users will need to use any of the lower-level functions described above.  If the data is not in the correct format (gage, date as character mm/dd/yyyy, flow as cfs), then
the function `format_and_process` should be used instead.  The options are described in the comments in
`format_input_df`.

Example data can be generated by `example_gagedata`.  Thus, running `process_gages(example_gagedata())` will demonstrate the
full functionality of the script as far as annual flow results are concerned.

## Development

1. For older to newer python upgrade

   ```
   python server, when not able to create python env
   python -m venv test --without-pip
   source test/bin/activate
   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
   ```

## Error and Bug

Use [Trello](https://trello.com/funcflow) to keep upload error message, a screen shot, and raw data file used

## Options

[iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/): iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal

```
find . -name '*.rdb' -exec sh -c 'mv "$0" "${0%.rdb}.csv"' {} \;

  pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Flask server

To start flask server, first init virtualenv and then install all dependencies. `flask run`
